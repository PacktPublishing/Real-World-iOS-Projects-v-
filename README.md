## About the Video Course
o you have some programming experience from a school course? Have you dabbled in your free time, but are using outdated technology in your current career? Are you overwhelmed by the complexity of the iOS ecosystem? 

Well, fear not! With this course, we'll get you started right away. You'll be taken through the development of three native iOS applications, using the core UIKit application framework and the latest version of Apple's new and exciting Swift programming language. We'll start by showing you how to get Xcode and guide you through its help documentation and debugger. Then you will build your first app from scratch - a custom web browser with your own custom controls, page history, and sharing functionality. 
Once the web browser is ready, you'll head straight into your second project, which is a note-taking app, which will permit full text editing and will store its data as JSON on your local device's file system. Your final project will be a rich, smooth, and colorful media-heavy app that navigates movies in the iTunes store, smoothly browses through posters, and explores their details.

By the end of the course, after focusing on getting real results, you'll be equipped with the skills to get started turning your development career dream into a reality!

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
You don't need any experience developing for iOS and programming in Swift. You should have some programming experience using at least one modern, object-oriented programming language, such as Java, JavaScript, C#, Python, or C++.
### Technical Requirements
This course has the following software requirements:<br/>
SETUP AND INSTALLATION

For successful completion of this course, students will require the computer systems with at least the following:

Any relatively recent Mac computer from the past 5-6 years, running macOS Sierra/High Sierra. 
We'll be working with Xcode 9, but it should also be able to follow this course on older versions.
