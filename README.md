## About the Video Course
o you have some programming experience from a school course? Have you dabbled in your free time, but are using outdated technology in your current career? Are you overwhelmed by the complexity of the iOS ecosystem? 

Well, fear not! With this course, we'll get you started right away. You'll be taken through the development of three native iOS applications, using the core UIKit application framework and the latest version of Apple's new and exciting Swift programming language. We'll start by showing you how to get Xcode and guide you through its help documentation and debugger. Then you will build your first app from scratch - a custom web browser with your own custom controls, page history, and sharing functionality. 
Once the web browser is ready, you'll head straight into your second project, which is a note-taking app, which will permit full text editing and will store its data as JSON on your local device's file system. Your final project will be a rich, smooth, and colorful media-heavy app that navigates movies in the iTunes store, smoothly browses through posters, and explores their details.

By the end of the course, after focusing on getting real results, you'll be equipped with the skills to get started turning your development career dream into a reality!
